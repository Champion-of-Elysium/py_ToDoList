# ToDo List App  

### In this project, I wrote a todo list app in Python language, in both Desktop graphical and Command Line interface. :shipit:

_In both forms, the same work is done in a simple way_. In the todo list, you can add your tasks, edit them, and remove them from the list when the task is finished.

` **Command Line Interface** that you can see in the picture below, you can use the following commands:

- _**Add**_ : When you want to add a task to your list, type `add` and then write the task you want to add. _Example_:
`add clean my room`
- _**Show**_: When you want to see the list of tasks you have, type `show`.
- _**Edit**_: When you want to edit a task in your list, type `edit` and then enter the number of that task in the list. Next, you will see a message titled *"Enter new todo:"* where you rewrite the text of the selected task.
- _**Completed**_: When you want to remove a task from the list as a completed task, type `complete` and then enter the number of that task in the list.
- _**Exit**_: When you want to exit the program, type `exit`.

` In the image below, you can see the **Desktop graphical User Interface**.

- You can simply enter the task you want in the text box and then click the add option.
- Task lists are always visible.
- To edit a task, you can select it in the list, write its new version in the text box, and then click on the edit button. 
- When a task is finished and you want to remove it from the list, just select the task in the list, then click on the Complete button. 
- By clicking on the Exit button, you will exit the application.
